# lazerdrive-leaderboard-front
## What's this?
At Wizaplace, we often play at [lazerdrive.io](http://lazerdrive.io), we love this game :heart_eyes:

We decided to make a persisted leaderboard beacause the the score is lost when you close your game tab!
Before this project, one person of our team kept his tab always open to keep his 1st position!
This leaderboard is for you [Guillaume-Rossignol](https://github.com/Guillaume-Rossignol) :joy:
